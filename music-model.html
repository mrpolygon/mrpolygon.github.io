    Modeling Transient Levels of Musical Sounds via a Hermite Gaussian Wavelet Algorithm.

        <div class="grid-item3">

            $$\textbf{Introduction}$$
            Define a musical sound $s(t)$ as a sound that may be modeled with little error by a low number $L$ of discrete frequencies $f_{l}$ with respective amplitude contours $A_{l}(t)$:

            $$s(t) \approx \sum_{l=1}^{L}A_{l}(t)\sin(2\pi f_{l}t). \tag{1.}$$

            Most musical instruments, including notes of the piano, flute, clarinet, and tuba among others, create such musical sounds. Other instruments, mainly percussive, do not 
            create musical sounds as defined. <br><br>
            Given any musical sound here we present an algorithm for modeling it according to the approximation of <b>(1.)</b>. This algorithm can be described roughly by
            the following two-step process:

            <ol>
            <li> pass our musical sound through parallel band-pass filters to isolate prominent frequencies</li>
            <li> pass the output bands through respective sinusoidal amplitude contour filters (adapted moving average filters). </li>
            </ol>
            
            For conciseness we will formulate our theory
            from a continuous-time lense, however, please note that sampled sounds are necessarily discrete-time. This algorithm must be transcribed into such a framework in order 
            to implement it on real-world signals.<br><br>

            $$\textbf{General Theory}$$
            In order to begin, we must define two standard integral transforms that are used heavily in signal processing, and likewise are used heavily here.<br><br>

            We define the convolution of any two arbitrary signals $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ as

            $$ x(t) * y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\tau)y(t-\tau) \, \mathrm d\tau. \tag*{}$$

            We define the Fourier transform of any arbitrary signal $x(t)$ as
            
            $$ \mathcal{F}_{t}\left[x(t)\right](k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t)e^{-2\pi i kt} \, \mathrm dt. \tag*{} $$

            $$\textbf{Band Isolation}$$
            Now, in order to isolate any frequency band $f_{l}$ within $s(t)$, we convolve a specified wavelet $w_{l}(t)$ with $s(t)$. The wavelet we choose is based off the
            Gaussian wavelet in order to provide clear mediation between time and frequency resolution. Furthermore, by taking $n=0,1,2,\ldots$ fixed derivatives of the Gaussian, 
            we are able to model levels of transience within any given band of $s(t)$. Thus,

            $$ w_{l}(t) = \frac{\mathrm d^n}{\mathrm d t^n}\left[e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi^2\beta^2t^2}\right]e^{2\pi if_{l}t} \tag*{}$$ 

            where $\beta=2\sigma$ is interpreted as frequency bandwidth (with $\sigma$ being standard deviation) because

            $$ \mathcal{F}_{t}\left[e^{-\frac{1}{2}\pi^2\beta^2t^2}\right](k) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\frac{1}{\beta}e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} k^2}. \tag*{} $$

            Then, our filtered output $r_{l}(t)$ is given as

            $$ r_{l}(t) = \frac{2}{\max\left(\mathcal{F}_{t}\left[w_{l}(t)\right](k)\right)}\mathrm{Re}\left[s_{l}(t)* w_{l}(t)\right]. \tag*{} $$
            
            $$\textbf{Amplitude Extraction}$$
            We now are ready to determine our amplitude contour $A_{l}(t)$. To do this, we define a step-like function $u_{l}(t)$ as

            $$ u_{l}(t) = \begin{cases}1, & 0 \leq t < 1/f_{l} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \tag*{} $$

            and then we simply have

            $$ A_{l}(t) = \frac{\pi f_{l}}{2}\left|r_{l}(t)\right| * u_{l}(t) \tag*{} $$

            where we interpret the above convolution as an adapted moving average filter.

            $$\textbf{Model}$$

            Defining $\tilde{s}(t)$ as the musical sound's model, we may conclude that

            $$\tilde{s}(t) \approx \sum_{l=1}^{L}A_{l}(t)\sin(2\pi f_{l}t) \tag*{} $$

            where we understand that $\tilde{s}(t)$ is sufficiently similar to the original musical sound $s(t)$.
