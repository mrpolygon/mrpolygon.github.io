                Hello! My name is Hallie (she/her). I am transgender. Please read below to find out what that means to me and the challenges and successes I've experienced regarding 
                this aspect of my life.

            </p>

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px"> Terminology </p>
                <i>Transgender</i> is an umbrella term meaning <i>to have a gender identity that differs from what is typical of one's sex assigned at birth</i>. 
                As such, it is a vague descriptor, and what it means to be transgender will vary widely on an individual level and across cultures. 
                In this writeup, we will take any explanations to be my own personal experience as a transgender person, and should not be taken as prescriptive.<br><br>

                Some transgender people who desire medical assistance to transition their sex characteristics to that typical of the opposite sex may also use 
                the term <i>transsexual</i> to describe themselves. Transsexual people may be thought of as a subset of transgender people, 
                and this description may help some individuals explain themselves with more specific language. <br><br>
                
                However, many transgender people reject the label <i>transsexual</i>
                for various reasons, e.g. its historical association with pathologization. Some transsexual people reject the label <i>transgender</i> for various reasons, 
                e.g. its potential association with stereotypical gender roles and expressions. 
                There are no universally-accepted definitions and confusion is common. I identify with both words, or simply the shortened
                form <i>trans</i>, although I don't feel that scrutinizing these labels is very helpful.

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px"> Early Life </p>
                At ages 5-9 small signs of me being trans were expressed as:
                
                <ul>
                    <li> wearing my sister's dresses occasionally </li>
                    <li> doing feminine activities with my sister </li>
                    <li> watching feminine media like <i>Princess Diaries</i> and <i>America's Next Top Model</i> </li>
                    <li> wanting to have long hair </li>
                    <li> pretending to have female sex characteristics "like mommy" </li>
                    <li> being worryingly small (height and weight percentile &lt 1%) but liking it.</li>
                </ul>

                Much of the above could be explained as simple gender non-comformity (which would have been fine!) except for 2 aspects:
                
                <ol>
                    <li>I explicitly wanted to be a girl then </li>
                    <li>I did end up being trans</li>
                </ol>
                
                so retroactively we can interpret these behaviors and feelings as the early signs of transsexuality. Despite all this, I still 
                managed okay at being a boy (at that time). <br><br>

                At ages 9-17 I would probably be described as a slightly feminine boy, though still within norms. However, distressing feelings did start to  
                pop up more and more. There was the song <i>Temperature</i> by Sean Paul that sang "Wanna be the Papa, you can be the Mom" and I remember thinking to myself 
                <i>I want to be the mom</i> and getting sad. When we were given a snail to raise in 5th grade I told my friends that it would be cool if humans didn't have a sex like 
                we learned about snails. 
                When puberty hit, I found my sister's birth control and wanted to take it. I eventually looked up what 
                effects it would have had on a male body, and loosely began to understand that estrogen works on males (to develop female secondary sex characteristics), and 
                that the differences between males and females can be blurred. I wanted that, although I thought I was extremely weird for it. 
                Despite all this, I still managed okay at being a boy (at that time). I even had 
                a long-term girlfriend for a couple years. <br><br>

                At ages 17-22, from late high school to early college, I began to slip in terms of quality of life. It was then that I got the first of the "gay" slurs
                thrown at me (mostly by passing cars), and a gay friend of mine told me that his "gaydar" is strong and he was sure I was bi or gay. I began smoking marijuana heavily and 
                obsessively researching the mathematics of music to escape from various aspects of life. It was at this point that I not only wished to be a girl, but was becoming very distressed at being a boy. 
                I would look in the mirror and hated what I looked like, and I began having both obsessive-compulsive symptoms 
                (intrusive sexual thoughts, etc.) and pre-psychotic symptoms (auditory hallucinations, etc.) warping my ability to rationally perceive the world around me.
                However, I still did not explicitly consider myself trans until age 22. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px"> Coming Out </p>
                I admitted to myself that I was trans at the age of 22 and that I needed to medically transition to feel okay. I was still in college, but I was looking up
                terminology and history and learning everything I could about it. I began thinking about how I would tell others. I began to seriously consider
                how it would flip my life upside down and how it would begin hardships with being seen as an "other" in society. I knew many people wouldn't accept it, 
                and I could be discriminated against in jobs as a liability and how just leaving the house would risk jeers and harassment. I knew that certain parts of the US and the world in general 
                would not be safe for me to travel to. I began thinking of what I would need to do to pass as a woman for personal comfort and safety purposes, 
                and how much money that would potentially cost. I began reading about "arguments against transsexualism" and "theories of transsexualism". <br><br>
                Needless to say, this was not a good time in my life, and I finally hit rock bottom at the age of 24. I told my close friends and family that I was trans. When I first  
                told my mom that something was seriously wrong she first asked if I was in trouble with the law (no), then she asked if I was homosexual lol (eh, no, sort of? right track though).
                I professed that I was hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, primarily related to gender issues. 
                I soon got formally diagnosed with schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, then gender dysphoria. 
                Thankfully, my family and friends accepted me (though they were confused at first), and it was at this point that my life started getting better.

                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px"> Medical Transition </p>
                I began taking Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)- estradiol and spironolactone- on Aug 19, 2022 at the age of 26 after working remotely for about a year and saving money/planning.
                While being trans is unique for everyone, starting HRT has been the most important aspect of my transition and has significantly improved my quality of life. I am currently in the process of removing facial hair
                and considering what else I may need to have done. My goal is to be fully perceived by society as a woman by age 30, and I'm on track to do so. :) <br><br>
