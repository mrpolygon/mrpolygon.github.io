                Some may ask "why is it that big of a deal? 
                Can't you just accept that you are male and live like that?" I have to be honest. I have no idea why or how I'm trans, or why it's so important that I transition. However, 
                an analogy may help. Please consider a straight man for a second, and imagine we lived in a culture where being <i>gay</i> was somehow the norm. 
                Imagine society telling him he needs to marry a man and be intimate with a man. Most straight men would rightfully be disgusted at the entire idea of it. Now let's ask the
                analogical question: "why is it that big of a deal? Can't you just accept intimacy with a man?" The answer should be straightforward. Straight people likely have no idea
                why they are straight, yet they are and it's locked into their brains. It goes against life, liberty and pursuit of happiness to force them to love other men.
